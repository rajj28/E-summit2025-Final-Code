# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System

## Overview

The AI-Powered Fraud Detection System is a holistic solution designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in financial services. This system identifies spam calls, deepfake fraud in VKYC (Video Know Your Customer) sessions, and unauthorized financial transactions in real-time using advanced AI models and AWS cloud services. It enhances trust in digital communication and financial transactions while protecting vulnerable communities from scams and exploitation.

## Key Features

1. **Spam Call Detection**:
   - Transcribes call audio using AWS Transcribe.
   - Analyzes transcripts for phishing keywords using NLP (AWS Comprehend).
   - Flags calls based on metadata, such as call frequency and duration.

2. **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**:
   - Uses Amazon Rekognition for facial and video analysis.
- Anomaly detection in facial features and voice patterns using machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker.

3. **Financial Fraud Detection**
   - Anomaly detection on transaction data through unusual patterns monitored using AWS Glue for ETL processes.
   - Isolation Forests or custom models trained on SageMaker for anomaly detection algorithms.

4. **Real-Time Alerts**
   - Real-time notifications to the users through Amazon SNS.
- The user interface reporting and viewing of fraud alerts is built with AWS Amplify and Flask.

## System Architecture

The system architecture includes the following:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   Call recordings, VKYC videos, and transaction data are stored in Amazon S3.
   AWS Glue processes transaction logs for analysis.

2. **Processing and Detection**:
   Lambda functions trigger fraud detection workflows.
- SageMaker models analyze data for anomalies and deepfake detection.

3. **Alerts and Feedback**:
   - Amazon SNS sends real-time alerts to users.
   - A feedback loop improves detection accuracy through user reports.

## Impact

This project significantly enhances financial security by:
- Reducing financial losses from fraud.
- Protecting vulnerable populations from scams and phishing.
- Improving trust in digital transactions and VKYC processes.

## Uniqueness

This project excels with these points:
- **Holistic Approach**: Multiple fraud aspects covered within one solution (spam detection, deepfake analysis, and financial anomalies).
- **Scalability and Reliability**: Developed using AWS services to scale to high data volumes with minimal latency.
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Real-time detection and decision making are based on advanced machine learning models.

Implementation Steps

1.  AWS Environment Setup
    Configure the following AWS services: S3, Lambda, SageMaker, Rekognition, Glue, and SNS.

2. **Spam Call Detection**
- Transcribe call audio and analyze transcripts for spam indicators using AWS Comprehend.

3. **Deepfake Detection in VKYC**
- Detect facial and audio anomalies using Rekognition and SageMaker.

4. **Financial Fraud Detection**
- Analyze transaction patterns using Glue and anomaly detection models.

5. **Real-Time Alerts and Feedback
- Alert users of potential fraud through SNS and enable them to report the incidents through a UI developed with Flask and AWS Amplify.
